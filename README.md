## Introduction
Do dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA). Then utilize PCA to map the images in the data down to 2 dimensions.  
Build a 2-layers neural network to identify 3 differents types of fruit images and classify them into 3 classes. Including feedforward network and backpropergation algorithm to update the weights through loss functions.

## Data
Contains Data_train and Data_test for training and testing. Three folders named Carambola, Lychee, and Pear under two folders contain three classes of fruit.

In the partition for training, there are 490 images per class, split them into training, validation, and testing data.
